# Random-Forest-Regression-in-R
The Random Forest Regression Model is an extension of Decision Tree Regression model. It involves more than 1 tree to predict the value more accurately. Multiple trees combine to make the Random Forest Regression model.
A random forest is a meta estimator that fits a number of classifying decision trees on various sub-samples of the dataset and uses averaging to improve the predictive accuracy and control over-fitting. 
The Decision Tree algorithm has a major disadvantage in that it causes over-fitting. This problem can be limited by implementing the Random Forest Regression in place of the Decision Tree Regression. Additionally, the Random Forest algorithm is also very fast and robust than other regression models.
